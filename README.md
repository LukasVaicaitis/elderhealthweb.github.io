# Elderhealth Web project

This is a group project made by a 5 person team.

## My responsibilities: 
1. Managing the Azure Web server.
2. Established a cohesive design language across the site to ensure visual and functional consistency.
3. Developed several key features and interfaces, demonstrated in the screens below.
4. Created a short video to showcase and explain the project.
   
### The server administration tasks: 
1. Setting up a database.
2. Setting up different users for each team member.
3. Creating a background task with a socket to capture data from the Elderhealth app and store the data in the database.
